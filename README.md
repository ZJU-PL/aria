# ARIA

ARIA (Automated Reasoning Infrastructure & Applications) is a toolkit for automated reasoning, which provides a set of tools for constraint solving, theorem proving, and symbolic computation.

## Local Development Environment

Run the following command to setup the local development environment.
~~~~
bash setup_local_env.sh
~~~~


The script will use **uv** if installed (recommended, much faster); otherwise it will prompt for venv or Conda. It will
- Create a Python virtual environment if it doesn't exist
- Install the package and its dependencies (from pyproject.toml)
- Run unit tests if available

TBD:
- Test the scripts on different platforms, editors/IDEs, etc.

## Install the Library Locally

**With uv** (recommended; install from <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>):
~~~~
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # or on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e .
~~~~

With pip (dependencies are read from pyproject.toml):
~~~~
pip install -e .
~~~~

Then you can use the CLI tools and the Python API in your own code.

## Release the Repo to PyPI

TBD (The repository is not yet released to PyPI.)

Contributions are welcome. Please refer to the repository for detailed instructions on how to contribute.
